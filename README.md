# ECE-128-MultiSeg-Driver
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement a multi digit seven-segment display driver using a previously developed 4-bit BCD to seven-segment decoder. This project extends the functionality of a single digit display to support multiple digits through time-multiplexing, allowing all segments to appear continuously. By completing this lab, the student will gain practical experience in signal timing, and synchronization using clock-driven logic. Additionally, this exercise serves as an extension for digital systems such as counters, clocks, and numeric displays that require coordinated multi-digit outputs.
